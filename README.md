# siemens_nx_load_option_generator

This software makes assembly load options file that enable to read all parts from children folder.

Set load_option_generator.exe with setting.def on the parent folder where you want to apply to read part files from children folder.  
And double click to excecute. After that, you'll see load_options.def on same directory and load it on NX assembly load options.  
Now, it's ready to load part files from children  folders.

For make executable file, used pyinstaller.  
This software was made on the NX environment of version 11.  
This is not some organization project. I made it in day off for myself.
